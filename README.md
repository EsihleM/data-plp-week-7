# Data Analysis and Visualization Assignment

## Overview

This project involves analyzing and visualizing a dataset using Python. The dataset can be any CSV file, and the task includes loading, exploring, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the data. The steps in the assignment also include generating various plots such as line charts, bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots.

### Steps:

1. **Load and Explore the Dataset**
   - The dataset is loaded from a CSV file.
   - Basic inspection of the data is done using `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.isnull()` functions.
   
2. **Basic Data Analysis**
   - Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) are calculated using `.describe()`.
   - Grouping data by categorical columns (if applicable) and computing the mean of numerical columns for each group.
   
3. **Data Visualization**
   - Line chart: A time-series plot of a numerical column (e.g., sales or date).
   - Bar chart: Comparison of numerical values across categories (e.g., species and petal length).
   - Histogram: Visualization of the distribution of a numerical column (e.g., sepal length).
   - Scatter plot: Analysis of relationships between two numerical columns (e.g., sepal length vs. petal length).

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- A dataset in CSV format (you can use any dataset of your choice).

### Installation

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
